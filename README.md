# Daily Diary Project

Welcome to the Daily Diary project! This simple web application allows users to sign up or log in and maintain a personal diary. It consists of three main files: `index.php`, `loggedinpage.php`, and `connection.php`. `connection.php` is used to link to the database, while `index.php` serves as the sign-up and login page. Users can access their diaries and write entries on the `loggedinpage.php` page.
